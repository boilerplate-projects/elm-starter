A starter kit and reference application based in this repo below:

### About:
A simple Webpack setup for writing [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) apps:

* Dev server with live reloading, HMR
* Support for CSS/SCSS (with Autoprefixer), image assets
* Bundling and minification for deployment
* A snippet of example code to get you started!
* Route support


### Install:
Clone this repo into a new project folder, e.g. `my-elm-project`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dbeff/elm-starter my-elm-project
cd my-elm-project
```

Re-initialize the project folder as your own repo:
```shell
rm -rf .git         # on Windows: rmdir .git /s /q
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'first commit'
```

Install all dependencies using the handy `reinstall` script:
```shell
npm run reinstall
```
*This does a clean (re)install of all npm and elm packages, plus a global elm install.*

```shell
npm start
```

* Get coding! The entry point file is `src/elm/Main.elm`
* Browser will refresh automatically on any file changes..
